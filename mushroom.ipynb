    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, my goal is to use binomial logistic regression to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous. The idea is to gain more experience with exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, building binomial logistic regression models, and testing model assumptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data I am using is the [Mushroom dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/73/mushroom) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset has 8,124 observations with 22 features, was created in 1987, and last updated on August 10, 2023. Each row in the dataset represents an observation of one mushroom from one of 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family, along with corresponding characteristics sush as shape, color, habitat, etc. that can be used to predict its edibility."
